20,"1. At this price point, with 120hz display and FP sensor, unbeatable smartphone.
2. Camera quality is below average basically at night time.
3. 5G works so well. Jio gives nearly 500 to 600mbps in my area.
4. HyperOS out of the box. Till now, found no software issues. Debloat all the unnecessary apps to get a clean OS.
5. A good budget phone if you are planning to gift your mom or dad for normal usage.",Positive
