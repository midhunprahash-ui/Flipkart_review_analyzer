1,"The camera is good at this price range
Ram could be increased to 6gb atleast
The volume button feels Kind of cheap
But at this price point you can't really complaint"
2,"At this price range every thing is very good.
Battery 🔋 not feels like 5000mh draining very fast but you know a long display and performance good enough.
When I open the box it seems like I am not who open it first . Screen has many fingerprints and screen tape have many bubbles .
And the end nice product by Motorola 👍😊"

18,"The Moto G35 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance for everyday tasks. It has a large, vibrant display, a long-lasting battery, and a capable camera system. However, the processor can be a bit slow at times, and the software support is not as long as some competitors. Overall, the Moto G35 is a solid choice for those looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone.💯💯"

Phone works smoothly on normal use like phone calls, social media, watching webseries and anime etc... display and speakers are awesome in this category. Device doesn't heat up much on normal use. But, not that good for playing heavy games. It's okay for playing BGMI at 45 fps at a good graphics and it's stable. When it comes to games like Genshin impact..."
